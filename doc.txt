Instructions: 
This assessment is designed to thoroughly evaluate your skills in Frontend Engineering. 
Timeframe: You have four (4) days to complete the tasks. 
Please read and understand all instructions carefully before commencing. 
Expectations: 
We expect you to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas: 
● Building the application using React and Vite. 
● Ensuring type safety with TypeScript. 
● Effective state management through Redux. 
● Styling implementation using SCSS. 
● Preference for Mantine as the CSS framework. 
● Strict adherence to best practices, including modular, readable, reusable, and

Scenario: 
Automation rules in Markopolo enable users to define specific conditions and criteria for their 
advertisements. These rules empower Markopolo to automatically initiate or halt campaigns, as 
well as adjust bid amounts and budgets based on predefined parameters. 
Task: 
Your task is to implement the “Task portion of the Automation Rules”, enabling users to create 
rules with multiple conditions using AND or OR logic, with support for nested conditions. 
Requirements: 
1. Convert the provided Figma design into a React component. 
2. Implement the layout and styling according to the design using SCSS. 
3. Ensure the component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. 
4. Apply TypeScript typing where necessary. 
5. Integrate structured data format from the Notion file into your React application, utilizing 
Redux for state management. 
6. Establish a  Redux store and necessary actions/reducers for managing the task payload 
data. 
7. Define TypeScript types for the data. 
8. Provide visual feedback to users when an action is performed (e.g. changing the color of 
the condition button, Preview of the automation task actions). 
9. Update the UI to reflect the user's actions immediately. 
Resources: 
1. Figma design file for UI/UX 
2. Notion file for type schema 
Submission: 
To submit your assessment: 
1. Create a Git repository for your project and commit your code. 
2. Make the repository public & share the link with us for evaluation. 
3. Include a README file with instructions on how to run your application locally. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
Your assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 
1. Code quality and organization. 
2. Adherence to React, TypeScript, SCSS, and Redux best practices. 
3. Accuracy and completeness of the tasks. 
4. Faithfulness of the user interface to the provided Figma design. 
5. Thoughtful error handling and consideration of edge cases. 
Good luck with your assessment!
